# Setup

Make sure you're using Python 3, coroutines and some other stuff are required!

Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

PI: `sudo python3 jitter.py`
Host: `python3 host.py <ip-address of pi>`

If you are too lazy to set up the networking and just want always on:

PI: `sudo python3 jitter.py --standalone`
